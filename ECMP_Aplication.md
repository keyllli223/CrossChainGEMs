Technical contribution.

I took part in the "ETHToronto" hackathon (Virtual), which took place in July-August 2023.
I won 3rd place in the Starknet bounty.
I created a dApp that demonstrates the capabilities of cross-chain NFT transfers between EVM networks, as well as between the Starknet Goerli Testnet and Ethereum Goerli Testnet, which was implemented using the "L2â†’L1 messaging protocol".
